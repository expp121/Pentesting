# Pentesting Labs, containers and writeups

## Introduction

This repository was created with the intention saving and showing my progress in the [Pentesting Field] as I am learning, and also to track my progress.

What you can expect to see here:

- Docker containers, containing the actual challenge
- Challenge Writeups(Solutions)
- Standalone challenges
- And other stuff that I see fit to be here


## Doing the challanges(docker) 

If you want to try solving one of the challenges by yourself, feel free to do it!

For this you'l need to go to the container's folder and build it, this can be done by:

```sh

(sudo) docker-compose up -d

```

After that, you can find the container's ip by typing:


```sh
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' [container-name] 
```


> Note: Replace [container-name] with the name of the container (duhh).


Example:


```sh
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' memorapcheck_container
```

If you don't know how to get your container's name, just type:

```sh
docker ps
```
